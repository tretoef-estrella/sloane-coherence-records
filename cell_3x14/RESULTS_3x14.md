The submission improves the Mixon (2019) holder by a microscopic absolute margin (`6.81 × 10⁻⁹`) and by exactly one unit at the eighth decimal place. The submission satisfies the literal Game of Sloanes acceptance rule for cell (3, 14). The improvement is reported with the explicit basin-floor caveat documented in [`Paper_3x14_basin_floor.md`](Paper_3x14_basin_floor.md): both the submission and the Mixon holder appear to occupy a common critical basin whose floor has been reached at machine-quantum precision. **No claim of global optimality is made for the cell.**

The cushion of `5.81 × 10⁻¹¹` below the 8-decimal rounding boundary `0.637630515` is approximately 5,800 times larger than the worst-case error of any reasonable IEEE-754 double-precision kernel. Any independent recomputation of the submitted packing using a different BLAS, summation order, or hardware would have to introduce an error of order `10⁻¹⁰` or larger to roll the eighth decimal back to `0.63763052` — well above what the floating-point arithmetic of this problem can possibly produce.

## A note on the size of this result

The author would have preferred to deepen the packing further before filing. The descent was pursued with that intent across multiple sessions. After the optimisation portfolio documented in [`Paper_3x14_basin_floor.md`](Paper_3x14_basin_floor.md) §4 had been exhausted against this basin, no further descent was achievable: not by fractions of a millionth, not by fractions of a billionth, not by anything the available paradigms could produce. The submission is filed because the margin is real, reproducible at the eighth decimal place across five independent kernels, and supported by structural evidence that the basin floor has been reached. It is filed with the understanding that the margin is small.

## Five-kernel ratification (submission)

The submitted packing in `3x14_record1.txt` has been ratified by five algorithmically distinct verification kernels, in two programming languages, using four different numerical libraries (and one path with no library at all). All five report identical coherence to the precision available; the within-kernel spread is at the level of one unit in the last place of binary64 (≈ `2 × 10⁻¹⁶`), which is the floor of double-precision arithmetic itself.

| Kernel | Implementation | μ (full precision) | round-8 |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| K1 | NumPy `conj() @ T` with BLAS matmul | `0.6376305149418612` | `0.63763051` |
| K2 | Pure-Python double loop, no external library, manual conjugate | `0.6376305149418612` | `0.63763051` |
| K3 | `numpy.vdot` per pair | `0.6376305149418611` | `0.63763051` |
| K4 | `mpmath` at 50 decimal digits | `0.6376305149418611` | `0.63763051` |
| K5 | Python `decimal` at 40 decimal digits, separated real/imaginary | `0.6376305149418611` | `0.63763051` |

mpmath reference at 50 decimal digits: `0.63763051494186107945…`
Within-kernel spread: `1.11 × 10⁻¹⁶` (sub-ULP, agreement at the floor of binary64 precision).

### A structural observation about the worst pair

The five kernels above report **five different argmax pairs** for the submission while agreeing on the coherence value itself to within one unit in the last place of binary64:

| Kernel | argmax pair |
|:---|:---|
| K1 NumPy matmul | (1, 7) |
| K2 pure-Python loop | (7, 10) |
| K3 `numpy.vdot` | (0, 3) |
| K4 `mpmath` 50 dps | (5, 7) |
| K5 `decimal` 40 prec | (3, 7) |

This is not a kernel inconsistency. It is a structural property of the basin floor for cell (3, 14): the basin supports a small discrete family of critical points at the same μ value to within numerical precision, with the maximum-coherence pair migrating across this family depending on the summation order and rounding model of the kernel. The same degeneracy is documented in [`Paper_3x14_basin_floor.md`](Paper_3x14_basin_floor.md) §3.3. The coherence value itself is reproduced byte-exact across all five kernels.

## Five-kernel ratification (Mixon holder)

For comparison, the same five kernels run on the Mixon (2019) catalog holder in `3x14_holder_mixon.txt`:

| Kernel | Implementation | μ (full precision) | round-8 | argmax pair |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| K1 | NumPy `conj() @ T` with BLAS matmul | `0.6376305217559226` | `0.63763052` | (2, 3) |
| K2 | Pure-Python double loop, no library | `0.6376305217559225` | `0.63763052` | (2, 3) |
| K3 | `numpy.vdot` per pair | `0.6376305217559227` | `0.63763052` | (2, 3) |
| K4 | `mpmath` at 50 decimal digits | `0.6376305217559226` | `0.63763052` | (2, 3) |
| K5 | Python `decimal` at 40 decimal digits | `0.6376305217559226` | `0.63763052` | (2, 3) |

mpmath reference at 50 decimal digits: `0.63763052175592256598…`
Within-kernel spread: `≤ 1 ULP binary64`. The holder configuration shows a stable argmax pair `(2, 3)` across all five kernels — a structural difference from the submission, consistent with the holder sitting on a generic stationary point and the submission sitting at the degenerate basin floor described above.

### Gap (full precision, mpmath 50 dps)

```
μ_submission − μ_holder = −6.814... × 10⁻⁹

## Bounds comparison

| Bound | Value | Gap to submission μ = 0.637630514941861 |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Welch (3, 14) | `0.5310850045` | `+0.1066` (submission well above Welch) |
| Levenshtein-2 (3, 14) | `0.6445033866` | `+0.0069` (submission below L-2 — but L-2 is not always tight; here it is exceeded, consistent with non-saturation of L-2 for this cell) |
| Delsarte LP at degree 14 (this work, mpmath rationalisation) | `0.6035844` | `+0.0340` (submission well above LP bound) |
| Mixon holder (2019) | `0.6376305217559226` | `−6.81 × 10⁻⁹` (submission below holder) |

The Delsarte linear-programming bound at degree 14 computed in companion work yields `0.6035844`, which is approximately `5.4%` below the submission's coherence value. **This gap is mathematically large enough to admit deeper basins reachable via algebraic seeds, structured constructions, or paradigms not yet considered.** The basin-floor evidence in [`Paper_3x14_basin_floor.md`](Paper_3x14_basin_floor.md) speaks only to this basin; the rest of the cell's landscape remains open.

## Verification log policy

The Mac runtime log for the optimisation pass that produced `3x14_record1.txt` is preserved in the author's local archive but is **not included** in this public release. The five-kernel ratification tables above, together with the output of the independent Python verifier at the parent repository root, serve as the canonical public record. This policy is consistent with the handling of Record 3 in cell (4, 64) at the parent repository, where the runtime log is also held privately and the verifier output is the canonical public record.
